Chapter II
Common Instructions
• Your project must be written in C.
• Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check, and you will receive a 0 if
there is a norm error.
• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc.) except for undefined behavior. If this occurs, your project will be
considered non-functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
• All heap-allocated memory must be properly freed when necessary. Memory leaks
will not be tolerated.
• If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile that compiles your source
files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror, using cc.
Additionally, your Makefile must not perform unnecessary relinking.
• Your Makefile must contain at least the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.
• To submit bonuses for your project, you must include a bonus rule in your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, libraries, or functions that are not allowed in
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be placed in _bonus.{c/h} files, unless
the subject specifies otherwise. The evaluation of mandatory and bonus parts is
conducted separately.
• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile into a libft folder. Your project’s Makefile must compile
the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
• We encourage you to create test programs for your project, even though this work
does not need to be submitted and will not be graded. It will give you an
opportunity to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find these tests
especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use
your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
• Submit your work to the assigned Git repository. Only the work in the Git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will occur
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.

Description Write a shell

Your shell should:
• Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
• Have a working history.
• Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path).
• Use at most one global variable to indicate a received signal. Consider the
implications: this approach ensures that your signal handler will not access your
main data structures.

Be careful. This global variable must only store the signal number
and must not provide any additional information or access to data.
Therefore, using "norm" type structures in the global scope is
forbidden.

• Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the
subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
• Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
• Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
• Implement the following redirections:
◦ < should redirect input.
◦ > should redirect output.
◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
◦ >> should redirect output in append mode.
• Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
• Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values.
• Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline.
• Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
• In interactive mode:
◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.
• Your shell must implement the following built-in commands:
◦ echo with option -n
◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
◦ pwd with no options
◦ export with no options
◦ unset with no options
◦ env with no options or arguments
◦ exit with no options

The readline() function may cause memory leaks, but you are not required to fix them.
However, this does not mean your own code, yes the code you wrote, can have
memory leaks.

You should limit yourself to the subject description. Anything that
is not asked is not required.
If you have any doubt about a requirement, take bash as a referenc
